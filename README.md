# audiokiller
Simple program for starting favorites apps.

For me it is restarter for pulseaudio, however for u it can be everything, because it justs executes shell commands.
Data is stored using JSON.
UI is built using Java Swing.

The app is supposed to run on system's startup, however it is not always possible to set app's running this way on some systems.
For Linux it should be like changes to rc.local files or just Startup Applications accessible from the appropriate menu for * buntu OS's and so on.

Obviously it can run on Windows, however it is designed for Linux only. 
Theme set for Linux is [<i>Darcula Theme</i>](https://github.com/bulenkov/Darcula).
To run the app u MUST download the .jar from the URL give above.
