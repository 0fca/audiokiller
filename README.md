# StartUp! (oryginally audiokiller)
Simple program for starting favorites apps.

For me it is restarter for pulseaudio, however for u it can be everything, because it justs executes shell commands.
Data is stored using JSON.
UI is built using Java Swing.

App was designed to run on the system's startup but it can't chane the settings on your OS because of security policy and difference between distros.

Obviously it can run on Windows, however it is designed for Linux only. 
Theme set for Linux is [<i>Darcula Theme</i>](https://github.com/bulenkov/Darcula).
To run the app u MUST download the .jar from the URL give above.
